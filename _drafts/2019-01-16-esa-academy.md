In December I was lucky enough to be selected as one of 30 students from around Europe to attend the first ESA Academy Remote Sensing Workshop.

I outlined in my first post how much I love learning new things. I have a real envy of Physicists, Computer Scientists and Engineers. I admire the grasp of applied mathematics that they have. Well, on the workshop was a beautiful combination of scientists developing techniques and hardware, as well as those of us who apply these techniques and hardware.

So what did we learn?


The best thing about the whole course? Being in a room with people that smart. I absolutely love being in an environment where there's so much to learn from everyone around you.

Thanks to ESA for hosting the workshop!
